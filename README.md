# Moon's Crypto Bot ðŸŒš

**Moon's Crypto Bot** is an automated cryptocurrency trading bot designed to trade **BTC/KRW** on Upbit.

Notifications are sent via Telegram to keep you updated on trading activities.

## **Features**

- Automatically places limit buy orders for **BTC/KRW** at specific percentage dips (e.g., 1%, 2%, ..., 15%) from the daily open price.
- Customizable **minimum and maximum percentage dips** via `.env` file.
- Dynamically calculates and monitors available funds required for trading.
- Cancels unfilled orders before the next trading cycle.
- Sends real-time notifications to your Telegram bot for:
  - Order placements.
  - Order cancellations.
  - Insufficient funds warnings.
  - Filled orders and fund availability updates.

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moons-crypto-bot.git
cd moons-crypto-bot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed. Install required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following:

```plaintext
# Upbit API Keys
UPBIT_ACCESS_KEY=your_upbit_access_key
UPBIT_SECRET_KEY=your_upbit_secret_key

# Telegram Bot Details
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id

# Trading Settings
MIN_PERCENTAGE_DIP=1        # Minimum percentage dip to buy
MAX_PERCENTAGE_DIP=15       # Maximum percentage dip to buy
```

- Replace `your_upbit_access_key` and `your_upbit_secret_key` with your Upbit API credentials.
- Replace `your_telegram_bot_token` and `your_telegram_chat_id` with your Telegram bot token and chat ID.

### 4. Run the Bot
Start the bot by running:
```bash
python scheduler.py
```

---

## **How It Works**

### Daily Schedule

1. **00:05 UTC: Place Orders**
   - The bot fetches the daily open price of **BTC/KRW** and places limit buy orders at percentage dips specified by `MIN_PERCENTAGE_DIP` and `MAX_PERCENTAGE_DIP`.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - The bot monitors placed orders continuously.
   - When an order is filled, it triggers a funds check and notifies you via Telegram.

3. **23:55 UTC: Cancel Remaining Orders**
   - Any unfilled orders are canceled before the next trading cycle.
   - If insufficient funds are detected for the next day, a warning notification is sent.

---

## **Customization**

### Adjusting Percentage Dips
Modify the percentage dips by updating `MIN_PERCENTAGE_DIP` and `MAX_PERCENTAGE_DIP` in the `.env` file. For example:
- To trade between 5% and 10% dips:
  ```plaintext
  MIN_PERCENTAGE_DIP=5
  MAX_PERCENTAGE_DIP=10
  ```

### Notification Settings
The bot uses Telegram to notify you of:
- Placed and canceled orders.
- Filled orders.
- Insufficient funds.

Ensure your Telegram bot token and chat ID are correctly configured in the `.env` file.

---

## **Dependencies**

- Python 3.9+
- [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) â€“ Cryptocurrency exchange trading library.
- [APScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/) â€“ Scheduling library for running tasks.
- [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) â€“ Telegram bot integration.

Install all dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `requirements.txt`
```plaintext
ccxt
apscheduler
python-telegram-bot
python-dotenv
```

---

## **Limitations**

- **Exchange API Limitations**: Ensure your Upbit API allows sufficient requests for order placements and status monitoring.
- **Trading Fees**: The bot does not account for trading fees, so ensure you have additional funds available.
- **Telegram Notification Lag**: Notifications depend on Telegram API response times, which may cause slight delays.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### Common Errors
1. **`ModuleNotFoundError`**: Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Insufficient Funds Warning**: Ensure your Upbit account has enough KRW to cover the required funds for the next dayâ€™s orders.
3. **Order Placement Errors**: Verify your Upbit API credentials and check the `MIN_PERCENTAGE_DIP` and `MAX_PERCENTAGE_DIP` settings.

### Debugging Tips
- Use `print()` statements in `orders.py` and `scheduler.py` to debug.
- Check Telegram notifications for details on errors or warnings.

---

## **Future Improvements**

- **Dynamic Order Amounts**: Allow users to configure order sizes for specific percentage dips.
- **Support for Multiple Pairs**: Extend the bot to trade other currency pairs.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Use WebSocket APIs for faster and more efficient order status monitoring.
